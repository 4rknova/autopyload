Privacy Policy for AutoPyLoader
Effective Date: April 15, 2025
Extension Name: AutoPyLoader
Developer: Nikos Papadopoulos

1. Data Collection
AutoPyLoader does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. The extension operates entirely on the user's local device and only interacts with the user's configured pyLoad server.

2. Data Storage
The extension stores user settings (such as pyLoad server IP, port, username, and password) and a local history of submitted URLs using the browser’s chrome.storage.local API. This data is:
- Stored locally on the user's device
- Never sent to any third-party or external server
- Used solely to enable the core functionality of the extension

3. Permissions
AutoPyLoader requests the following Chrome extension permissions:
- activeTab and tabs: to access the URL of the current tab so it can be sent to pyLoad
- storage: to store user settings and download history locally
- host permissions (user-defined): to communicate directly with the configured pyLoad server

These permissions are required solely to support the extension’s single purpose and functionality.

4. Third-Party Access
AutoPyLoader does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services. No user data is ever shared with third parties.

5. Changes to This Policy
If this policy is updated in the future, users will be notified via the Chrome Web Store listing or a link in the extension.
